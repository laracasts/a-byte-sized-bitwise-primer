Hey there! I hope you enjoyed the episode. If you're up for the challenge I set you, here's how you can get the project running locally.

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into the project directory.
2. `composer install`
3. `cp .env.example .env`
4. `php artisan key:generate`
5. `touch database/database.sqlite`
6. `php artisan migrate`
7. `php artisan db:seed`

Visit the application in your browser and you should be good to go!
